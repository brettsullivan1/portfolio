        <h2><strong> About Me </strong></h2>
        <p> My first job at age fourteen was working for my dad's landscaping company. <br>
            Although some days were longer than others, working a rewarding job like that from such a <br>
            young age taught me many things that have helped me later in life.Two lessons that I have taken with me from a young age are:<br> 
        </p>
        <ol>
        <li>Working together is always better than working alone</li>
        <li>Hard Work always pays off</li>
    </ol>
        <p> And whatever life brings my way I always fall back on those two things.
        <br>As I a kid I loved learning and building whatever I could get my hands on and with Code I can finally turn that dream into reality.</p>
        <p> At <a href="http://thinkful.com" > Thinkful</a> I am very excited to start my coding journey but know that when I finish that my job has only start and I will continue to inspire to be a lifelong learner </p>
